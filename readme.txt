Display a floating ad banner while using Jetpack Mobile Theme.

== Description ==

More than ever before, if your WordPress site isn't mobile friendly, it risks falling behind the times. In fact, since [April 21, 2015](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2015/04/rolling-out-mobile-friendly-update.html), Google publicly announced that it would use mobile-friendliness as a search ranking factor. With more and more people browsing the web on their smartphones, solutions like Jetpack's [mobile theme](http://jetpack.me/support/mobile-theme/ "Jetpack Mobile Theme") have just about become mandatory in order to stay abreast of the ever-changing SEO landscape.

But what if you have been monetizing your WordPress site with text and banner ads like Google AdSense? If you've ever peeked at your site on a mobile browser, you may notice all your ads may be gone!

How to monetize this increasing amount of mobile web traffic while staying mobile-friendly?

Enter Jetpack Mobile Theme Floating Ad!

On a tiny mobile browser, simplicity works best: a solitary floating ad that hovers over your site in Jetpack Mobile Theme mode, even if the user scrolls!

Simply supply your ad code and Jetpack Mobile Theme Floating Ad takes care of the rest, overlaying a floating ad that only appears on your mobile site and allowing you to monetize your mobile traffic.
